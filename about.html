                <p class="section-focus">Cybersecurity Foundation. Analytical Mind.</p>
                <p>After pursuing my studies in cybersecurity, I realized that protecting systems isn't just about responding to threats. It's about understanding them, anticipating them, and building defenses that last. This insight fueled my journey beyond theory, combining technical expertise with an analytical mindset focused on measurable impact.</p>

                <p class="section-focus">Specialized in SOC & Digital Forensics. Driven by Results.</p>
                <p>I immersed myself in SOC operations, incident response, digital forensics, and secure programming, mastering evidence-driven, data-based methods to detect, analyze, and mitigate cyber threats. My goal is simple: translate complex security challenges into actionable solutions that anyone on a team can understand and implement effectively.</p>

                <p class="section-focus">Tested Methods. Tangible Security.</p>
                <p>My work isn't just theoretical—it's hands-on, tested, and results-driven. From identifying sophisticated attacks and securing systems to documenting clear evidence chains and implementing robust security measures, every project I do is designed to produce measurable improvements in organizational resilience, threat mitigation, and operational security.</p>
